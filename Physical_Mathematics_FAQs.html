<h2>Reimbursement:</h2>

<p></br><p>If we've offered you travel support, please bring your receipts with you to the summer school.  Receipts must include proof of purchase (so, for instance, boarding passes or confirmation e-mails that do not include proof of payment are not needed).  During the week we will provide reimbursement forms for you to complete to begin the travel reimbursement process.</br><p></br>

<p>In addition, if your travel is being supported by us, please book your flights using a US airline if possible, since this is simpler for us to reimburse.  Don't worry if you've already booked flights using a non-US airline, we will still be able to provide your reimbursement.
