<h1>Course Outlines</h1>

There will be three series of lectures, on The Seiberg-Witten Equations and Symplectic Geometry, Heegaard Floer Theory, and Sutured Manifolds.  The Heegaard Floer and sutured manifold lectures will be particularly closely linked, and each series will rely on earlier talks in the other.

<p>  
<h3><b>Heegaard Floer series:</b></h3></br> 
Heegaard Floer theory is an analogue of Seiberg-Witten theory, defined in terms of holomorphic curves.  This lecture series we will focus on the definitions of (some of) the Heegaard Floer invariants, as well as their basic properties.  Later lectures in the series will focus on bordered Floer homology, an extension of Heegaard Floer theory, and how it fits in with the rest of the subject.

<p>
<h3><b>Sutured manifold series:</b></h3></br>
 A sutured manifold is a 3-manifold with boundary divided into an "upper" and a "lower" piece.  They naturally arise in the study of foliations and contact structures.  In this companion series to the Heegaard Floer series, we will use sutured manifolds to show how Heegaard Floer homology gives geometric information.

<h3><b>The Seiberg-Witten Equations and Symplectic Geometry</b></h3>

<p>
These lectures will focus on the Seiberg-Witten monopole equations in 4, 3 and 2 dimensions, emphasizing their connections to symplectic geometry.  

<p>
One such connection is that, in a symplectic 4-manifold, monopoles localize -  in the "Taubes limit" - on holomorphic curves.  Another is that monopoles on the product of two Riemann surfaces correspond, in the  "adiabatic limit" where one factor is stretched, to holomorphic maps from the stretched surface to a symmetric product  of the other.  A third is that the boundary values of 3-dimensional monopoles trace out a Lagrangian submanifold of the symplectic vector space of fields on the boundary. 

<p>
I hope to outline how such ideas lead to an isomorphism of monopole Floer homology with Heegaard Floer homology and to conjectural extensions of the monopole TQFT down to 2 dimensions.
