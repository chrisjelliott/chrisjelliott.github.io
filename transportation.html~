<h3>How to Get There</h3>
The Northwestern mathematics department has travel information available at
<a href="http://www.math.northwestern.edu/aboutUs/visitors.html">http://www.math.northwestern.edu/aboutUs/visitors.html</a>
Chicago is served by two airports: O'Hare and Midway.  We hope to be able to organise shuttle buses from the airports for most participants: more information about this, and further logistical information, will be provided closer to the time. 

<h3>The Venue</h3>
Talks will be held in the <a href="http://www.transportation.northwestern.edu/">Northwestern Transportation Center</a>, on Northwestern's Evanston campus. A campus map is available online at <a href="http://maps.northwestern.edu">http://maps.northwestern.edu</a>.  Some sessions may also be held in the mathematics department in Lunt Hall.

<h3>Accommodation</h3>
We will be housing all participants that requested accommodation at the <a href="http://www.thehomestead.net/">Homestead Hotel</a>, and the Garret next door.  These comfortable venues are only a short walk from the Northwestern campus.
